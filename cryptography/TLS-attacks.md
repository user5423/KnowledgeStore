### TLS Security

This takes a look at the most common/known security attacks against TLS

An RFC was put together that summarises known TLS attacks which can be found here:
- https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7457.html

Although the RFC was created in 2015, it is pretty concise and explains the general attacks that SSL/TLS was facing at the time (including historically). Mitigiations have been put in place, and new vulnerabilities have been devisied in a constant back-and-forth cycle between defender and attacker. However, this should give you a bit more understanding of the lay of the land
